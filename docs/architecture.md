The escrow contract transitions through the following states to ensure funds are securely managed between the Buyer and Seller.

1. **Locked**: 
   - Initial state when the Buyer deposits funds.
   - Funds are held in the contract.
   
2. **Delivered**:
   - The Seller has fulfilled the service or delivered the goods.
   - Waiting for the Buyer to confirm receipt.
   
3. **Released**:
   - The Buyer confirms receipt.
   - Funds are transferred to the Seller.
   - Terminal state.

4. **Disputed**:
   - Either the Buyer or Seller raises an issue before funds are released.
   - A Mediator (PadiPay admin or decentralized arbiter) steps in.
   - Terminal state resolution depends on the Mediator's decision.
   
## Contract Methods (Overview)
